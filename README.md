Simple python based HTTP server. Mostly used for getting to grips with running Docker and Kubernetes.

This was built in a Debian based WSL environment. Any linux environment should also do, as long as you have installed:
- python3
- docker
- minikube
- kubectl

This is also a test to see if changes are coming through in Azure DevOps.
